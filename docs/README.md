# JS MythBusters

> A JavaScript optimization handbook from a high level point of view.

# What is it

The purpose of this handbook is to learn how to use JS language features without losing performance.

You can check [Six Speed](https://kpdecker.github.io/six-speed/) to see how much faster ES6 runs. Also, [Node Green](http://node.green/) displays the native support of each feature.
